Contributing is simple, you&quot;ll just need a couple of simple tools.

1. [node](http://nodejs.org/) is used to run the example server
2. [npm](https://www.npmjs.org/) is used to install package dependencies, like TypeScript and Three.js
3. [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) is used for running build scripts and tests
4. [browserify](http://browserify.org/) is used to package fossa for browsers

You&quot;ll want to follow the instructions to install each of these tools on the corresponding websites. Then, you just need to run gulp to lint, compile, and run the unit tests to make sure you didn&quot;t break anything before you make a pull request.

Generally, I like to use the [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html) model for contributing, so just fork, branch, and PR master.

Thanks for the contributions!
